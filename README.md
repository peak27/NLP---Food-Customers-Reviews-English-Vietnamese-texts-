# NLP-Food-Customers-Reviews-English-Vietnamese-texts-
This repo consists the NLP implementation on English and Vietnamese text to find out how people are reacting and to learn their concerns in the world of food.

# Association Rule (w/ Python & R)
This repository contains the Association Rules such as Apriori and Eclat which can be useful to build recommender system with Machine Learning. You will find these two techniques on R and Python throughout this Repository.

# **Project name:** # Classifications (w/ Python & R)

## Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In machine learning, association rule learning is a rule-based method for identifying interesting relationship between the variables in a large dataset. With the help of some interestingness, it is intended to identify strong rules. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this repository, we are implementing some commonly used Association rules such as Eclat and Apriori.

## Installation 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be able to apply these regression techniques to predict outcome on your dataset you need to have following tools and libraries:
  * Python 2.x or Python 3.x
  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * Scikit-Learn
  * R (For R implementation)

## Usage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association rule learning is important to build the recomender funtionality on your system such as e-commerce website or social media. One most common example of association rule is to identify that the people who bought diapers will also purchase beer. As the possibility, he might be babysitting and needs beer to spend his boring time at home.
